an easy way to change your Pulse Audio Sound Settings

I gew tired of pecking thru the GUI
I gew tired of the complicated pactl listing & changing sink numbers
so I wrote a script

I started with a Terminal version the found Zenity
if you don't have Zenity, install it

put these scripts in '~/bin' or '~/.local/bin' to hide them
make sure you have '~/data' or edit 'title-80.sh'
you can add 'pactl-z.sh' to a key shortcut or launcher button, I use both

I have paths to '~/bin' & '~/.local/bin'
put your user name in $USER below
no you don't have to use './script' but just 'script'

PATH="/home/$USER/.local/bin:/home/$USER/bin:/home/$USER/plot:/usr/bin:/usr/games:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/local/sbin"

feel free to modify what you like
you will explore Terminal Menus, Zenity Dialogs, & AWK!
you will learn to use NAMES with PACTL, not numbers (which can change)

I really like AWK!
ENJOY!
Liz

   pactl

list pactl
   lspactl.sh        main script, uses title-80.sh
   lspactl.awk       sorts out the mess of pactl

change pactl settings using zenity - my favorite
   pactl-z.sh        main zenity script, multi-monitor selective for test
   pactl-o.sh        display utility used by pactl-z.sh
   pactl-o.awk       used by pactl-o.sh

change pactl settings using terminal - how it started
   pactl.sh          main script, uses title-80.sh
   pactl.awk         display utility



don't really need the following, you will have to remove in scripts

display utility
   title-80.sh       used by pactl.sh & lspactl.sh
   title.sh          used by title-80.sh, needs ~/data/title.dat
   title.awk         formatter for title.sh

sound test
   thx.sh            video test used by pactl.sh & pactl-z.sh
                     you will need to modify this to whatever video test you use
                     and you need 'mplayer'

video test
   xrandr.sh         test connected monitors, return error $?
   xrandr.awk        1=internal, 2=hdmi, 3=tv
